## Description
 This applicaiton will keep track of an individual student’s pre-professional and professional program GPA and the status of the student’s professional program application. It will have information about the student’s advisor, how far along they are in their degree program, and allow the student to fill out the professional program application automatically. After project completion, it will be maintained by CIS faculty and staff. 

 The Client side is built using React JS, in the backend the application is using Express and using Postgresql database. [Link to Database Tables](server/dbtables.txt)
