## Description
 This application is designed to replace the current professional program application while retaining its core functionality and introducing new features. It helps students track their pre-professional and professional program GPA, monitor the status of their professional program application, and access information about their advisor and degree progress. Additionally, it streamlines the application process by allowing students to auto-fill their professional program applications.

 New features include a student profile where students can connect their Discord and GitHub accounts, as well as a modular design that allows for the addition of new components and sub-applications as needed. Once completed, the project will be maintained by K-State CIS faculty and staff.

 The client was built with Vue.js and the server utilizes Express and PostgreSQL. [Link to Database Tables](docs/diagrams/Database_Schema.pdf)

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites** 
* Software required
    * Node.js (version 16/18 or higher)

### **Running the Project**  
1. Start a codespace.
2. Wait a couple of minutes for the codespace to build AND for the postcreate command to complete.

#### **Server Side**  
- If the postcreate command did not run, install dependencies:  
  ```sh
  cd server && npm install
  ```
- Ensure the environment variables are set in the [docker-compose](.devcontainer/docker-compose.yaml) file.
- In the server directory, run the server:  
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

#### **Database**  
- If the postcreate command did not run, run database migrations and seed data:  
  ```sh
  cd server && knex migrate:latest --knexfile configs/knexfile.js && knex seed:run --knexfile configs/knexfile.js
  ```

#### **Client Side**  
- If the postcreate command did not run, install dependencies:  
  ```sh
  cd client && npm install
  ```
- In the client directory, run the client:  
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
