The discord bot has a few requirements. Most of which are set up in the Github Secrets and a custom Discord server. 

Firstly: 
Create a new discord server. Copy the ID into the discordbot.js in linked roles on line 38. This is where the bot grabs the specific guild information. 

Make a few custome roles titles CIS 115, CIS 200, CIS 300. Copy the role IDs and put them in discordbot.js in linked roles on line 16.
This makes it easier to convert from the queried courses in the database into usable discord role IDs.

For the discord bot. You must go to the discord developer portal and create a new discord bot. 
To create the URL for the bot, in the OAuth2 page select bot and then Manage Roles, then guild install. This link will allow you to add the bot to your server. 

You will need the following below as discord secrets in your Github. All of which can be found in the developer portal.
