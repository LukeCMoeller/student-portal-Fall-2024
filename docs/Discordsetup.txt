The discord bot has a few requirements. Most of which are set up in the Github Secrets

The following:

DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET
DISCORD_SECRET

must all be generated from the discord developer portal. 

Follow the steps here in the README https://github.com/JustinBeckwith/linked-role-bot to set up the linked roles.
Glitch is not needed as the files are located in server/linked-roles/linked_roles_glitch. 

In the discordbot.js file. After adding the bot to the intended server, replace the server id on line 38 with the new server

To test the automatic roles in the admin page, you must have seeding of a test user linked with a discord account. Make sure they have
the classes that are seeded with the roles.
